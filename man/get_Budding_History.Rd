\title{Extract budding history from simulations}
\usage{
get_Budding_History(sim)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim}{A simulation object generated with 'sim_Mk_budding_exp', 'sim_Mk_trace_history', 'sim_BM_budding_exp', or 'sim_BM_trace_history'.}
}
\value{
a list. budd_nodes are the nodes representing budding speciation events. budd_edges is an index, in the same order of phy$edge, selecting all branches belonging to mother lineages. A mother lineage is a lineage that survived one or more speciation events (because of budding).
}
\description{
This function can be used to extract the history of budding events across the branches and nodes of the tree.
